 <h1>History of The House of Palastinate-Zweibrucken </h1>
 <p>The House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, a branch of the Wittelsbach dynasty, was the ruling dynasty of Sweden from 1654 to 1720.

    By this point it had splintered into several different houses. The Royal House of Sweden was represented by the branch Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Kleeburg.
